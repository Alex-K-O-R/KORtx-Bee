<p>Hello. I am Alexander Kormilitsin. Sometimes, on the good times, I may look like this fella on the picture:

</p>
<p>I was born and grew up in the Vladimir city, graduated from Vladimir State University with engineer speciality. In the past I used to
    work either a full time, a part-time, as a freelancer, and even did a job miles away from my speciality.</p>
<p>Since I had chosen the path web sites and services development, and had tried on a lot of
    CMS, template-builders and frameworks, in time I got to the insight, that probably, things could be a lot easier and comfortable.</p>
<p>And I've tried to make it. And did it. Some slice of that total result you can observe right here...
    See <a href="<?=Pages::about?>">"About"</a> page with KORtx Bee framework description that is the basis of this microsite.</p>
<p>I hope, you would at least find it interesting. <img src="/Install/demo/display/img/author/smile.png" class="smiley" /></p>
